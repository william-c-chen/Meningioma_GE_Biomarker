# Meningioma_GE_Biomarker
This repository includes the R code used to generate gene expression risk scores from Nanostring gene count data as reported in the manuscript "Targeted gene expression profiling predicts meningioma outcomes and radiotherapy responses" by Chen et al. The "Files" directory contains RNAseq TPM data used in the analytical validation portion of the manuscript. A traceable and reproducible version of risk score calculation using the locked model for FFPE samples from RTOG 0539 is available by request.
